# Repository Overview

Welcome to the repository overview! This repository serves as a collection of Jupyter notebooks and related content. It's a dynamic space where I'll continue to add various types of content for learning, experimentation, and reference.

## Contents

### Atelier 1 : Simple and Multiple Linear Regression

- **Introduction**: Introduces simple and multiple linear regression for predicting sales.
- **Data Overview**: Provides an overview of the dataset, including data types and summary statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the relationship between advertising budgets and sales.
- **Training and Testing**: Demonstrates data splitting for training and testing.
- **Linear Regression**: Shows how to perform linear regression using batch gradient descent.
- **Model Evaluation**: Explains how to calculate model error (MSE) on the test data.
- **Cross-Validation**: Demonstrates k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.
- **Comparison**: Compares the model error and cross-validation mean MSE.
- **Conclusion**: Discusses results and potential model improvements.

### A Star Search : A* Search Algorithm
- This code snippet represents the A* Search Algorithm. It finds the shortest path from an initial state to a goal state in a graph or grid using a heuristic estimate and a successor function. It maintains open and closed sets, explores successors, and returns the optimal path or failure if the goal cannot be reached.
